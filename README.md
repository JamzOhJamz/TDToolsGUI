# TDToolsGUI

Free account tools to interact with and exploit TacticalDuty.io servers. This project was designed in just a few hours to prove that the developer has no idea what they're doing when it comes to making multiplayer games, or even just programming in general.

## Is it Safe?

It's open source software, see for yourself.
